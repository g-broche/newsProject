Discovering API and AJAX and experimenting in the context of an API for news

After having learned how to handle local data in a project using html, css and javascript, the training course now moves on toward getting data from exterior sources using API endpoints.

For this project, the aim is to fetch data from News API to display some articles and headlines. The user has the possibility to change the request that will be made by using several different inp.

the API key used has a limit of 1000 daily calls, so there is a possibility that it expires during use.
